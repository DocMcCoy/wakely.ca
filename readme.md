### Wakely Portfolio site

Here is a site that I built as my final project of the Web Dev course at SAIT in 2018. 

The Web Dev course was a 3.5 month course that delved into HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. This site was built using all of these and the Laravel PHP framework. On top of technologies, I also learned a little about Dev Ops while finishing this project and deploying it.

If you have any questions, please checkout the website and contact me through the contact form!
